            <h2>1. Ransomware</h2>
            <p class="indent-text">
                Imagine your computer files are locked and held hostage by a digital bandit. 
                This cybercriminal demands money from you to release your files. 
                It's like your computer is kidnapped, and you have to pay a ransom to set it free.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="threat">
            <h2>2. Phishing</h2>
            <p class="indent-text">
                Picture this: You receive an email that looks legit, like it's from your bank or a trusted website. 
                But, surprise! It's actually from a sneaky imposter trying to trick you into sharing sensitive information, like passwords or credit card details. 
                It's like fishing for your personal info with a fake bait.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="threat">
            <h2>3. Malware</h2>
            <p class="indent-text">
                Think of malware as the bad apples in the digital world. 
                Malicious software (malware) can infect your computer and cause harm, like viruses or spyware. 
                It's like a virtual disease that you want to avoid catching on your devices.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="threat">
            <h2>4. Social Engineering</h2>
            <p class="indent-text">
                Envision someone using psychological tricks rather than technical skills to manipulate you. 
                Social engineers might pretend to be a friend, colleague, or even tech support to get you to reveal confidential information. 
                It's like someone playing mind games to gain access to your personal data.
